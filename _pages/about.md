I am a research assistant professor and the IEMS alumni fellow at McCormick School of Engineering at Northwestern University. [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ibanerj750/Ibanerj750.github.io/master/files/Resume.pdf) is my CV. 

Before joining Northwester, I was a PhD student under [Vinayak Rao](https://varao.github.io/) and [Harsha Honnappa](https://engineering.purdue.edu/SSL/about) at Purdue University. [Here](https://hammer.purdue.edu/articles/thesis/PROBABLY_APPROXIMATELY_CORRECT_BOUNDS_FOR_ESTIMATING_MARKOV_TRANSITION_KERNELS/24735312) is a link to my thesis.



**My main research areas include:** 
Statistical inference of controlled Markov chains,
Sparsistency and support recovery in high dimension problems, 
and Bandits. I am also interested in statistical inference on non-Euclidean geometries: Such as Riemannian manifolds.

Prior to joining Purdue, I completed my Bachelors and Masters in Statistics from Indian Statistical Institute. 
My Master's specialization was in Mathematical Statistics.

My [Erdős number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) is 4. Imon Banerjee ---> Jean Honorio ---> Tommi Jakkola ---> Noga Alon ---> Paul Erdős
