I am a research assistant professor and the IEMS alumni fellow at McCormick School of Engineering at Northwestern University. [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ibanerj750/Ibanerj750.github.io/master/files/Resume.pdf) is my CV. 

Before joining Northwestern, I was a PhD student under [Vinayak Rao](https://varao.github.io/) and [Harsha Honnappa](https://engineering.purdue.edu/SSL/about) at Purdue University. [Here](https://hammer.purdue.edu/articles/thesis/PROBABLY_APPROXIMATELY_CORRECT_BOUNDS_FOR_ESTIMATING_MARKOV_TRANSITION_KERNELS/24735312) is a link to my thesis.

Prior to joining Purdue, I completed my Bachelors and Masters in Statistics from Indian Statistical Institute. 
My Master's specialization was in Mathematical Statistics.

My [Erdős number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) is 4. Imon Banerjee ---> Jean Honorio ---> Tommi Jakkola ---> Noga Alon ---> Paul Erdős.

**I am on the 2025 academic job market.**

**On Research:** 
I love learning about new topics, and find research extremely fun. Recently, I explored an interesting phenomenon for the Edgeworth expansion of Bootstrapped **Studentized** sample quantiles. This was first documented by Hall and Marting ([paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/0047-259X(91)90032-W)). This is unique to the Studentized case and does occur for the un-Studentized estimates. We showed that this phenomenon persists with an appropriate rate for the m-out-of-n Bootstrap estimator (see [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BvXylMoT_WYRMb5BBmQ9Fd0A-g03xDzC/view?usp=sharing)).

Currently, I am reading about geometrical interpretations of statistics, pioneered by Efron in papers [1](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2958246), [2](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2958883), and further developed more recently in [3](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26542840). The book by Kass and Vos ([link](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118165980)) provides a good introduction. I am also generally interested in geometry, and find it very intuitive. So if you have ideas and think I can help, shoot me an email. I would be most happy to discuss.

**Prior Work:** The main thrust of my research during my PhD was in Markov chains, with both [Bayesian](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/23/3/313) and [Frequentist](https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2023.0046) flavors. In a trio of papers, one of which is published, and two of which are upcoming, I rigorously developed statistics on controlled Markov chains under both finite and continuous state spaces. I am currently collecting these three works into a monograph, which I plan to make available on my website. 

I also recently worked on a non-Gaussian extension of the Kalman filter (see [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14053)) with Itai Gurvich, and worked with Jean Honorio on sparse principal component analysis (see [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07092)).
