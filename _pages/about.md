I am a research assistant professor and the IEMS alumni fellow at McCormick School of Engineering at Northwestern University. [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ibanerj750/Ibanerj750.github.io/master/files/Resume.pdf) is my CV.

I love learning about new topics, and find research extremely fun. Before joining Northwestern, I was a PhD student under [Vinayak Rao](https://varao.github.io/) and [Harsha Honnappa](https://engineering.purdue.edu/SSL/about) at Purdue University. [Here](https://hammer.purdue.edu/articles/thesis/PROBABLY_APPROXIMATELY_CORRECT_BOUNDS_FOR_ESTIMATING_MARKOV_TRANSITION_KERNELS/24735312) is a link to my thesis. Prior to that, I completed my Bachelors and Masters in Mathematical Statistics from Indian Statistical Institute. 

My [Erdős number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) is 3. Imon Banerjee ---> Diego Klabjan ---> Criag A. Tovey ---> Paul Erdős.

**I am on the 2025 job market.**

**Fall 2025:**  Currently, I am reading about geometrical interpretations of statistics, pioneered by Efron in papers [1](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2958246), [2](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2958883), and further developed more recently in [3](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26542840). The book by Kass and Vos ([link](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118165980)) provides a good introduction. I am also generally interested in geometry. I am also learning about new and upcoming methods in nonparametric Statistics, namely $\rho$-estimators [1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00222-016-0673-5). I have worked on two projects related to their predecessors, namely T-estimators in Markov chains ([preprint for one of those](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14458)). So if you have ideas and think I can help, shoot me an email. I would be most happy to discuss.

**Summer 2025:** Spring and Summer of 2025 went really quickly working on two statistical problems on regenerating Markov chains. One of them was spent on exploring the m-out-of-n counterpart of an interesting phenomenon for the Edgeworth expansion of Bootstrapped Studentized sample quantiles first documented by [Hall and Marting](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0047259X9190032W?via%3Dihub). Along the way, we also proved guarantees beyond i.i.d. data, namely when it is generated from a regenrating Markov chain. This paper was **accepted** at NeurIPS 2025 ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11725)).

We also derived a new method for offline change point detection ([preprint](https://drive.google.com/file/d/160QOQfYa3aiJN88jMITXoL5D-skyGNW1/view?usp=sharing)) when the data arrives from a regenerating Markov chain. I am pretty excited about this work, especially since we have found a mixed integer linear program to efficiently solve this objective, which is quite different from existing methods like PELT or Binary Segmentation. Along the way, we also found out that Bennett-type inequalities for the empirical suprema of Markov chains have been an open problem for nearly 2 decades now!!!

  <summary>Spring 2025</summary>
  I worked on a non-Gaussian extension of the Kalman filter (see [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14053)) with Itai Gurvich where we showed the the Kalman filter (which is the best linear unbiased estimator) is actually **sub-optimal** in estimating the state when the noise is non-Gaussian. We then propose a modified esimator based on a prescription by [Eimear Goggin](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/135648) which performs an order of magnitude better than the Kalman filter.

  <summary>Prior Work</summary>

 The main thrust of my research during my PhD was in Markov chains, with both [Bayesian](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/23/3/313) and [Frequentist](https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2023.0046) flavors. In a trio of papers, one of which is published, and two of which are upcoming, I rigorously developed statistics on controlled Markov chains under both finite and continuous state spaces. I am currently collecting these three works into a monograph, which I plan to make available on my website.
